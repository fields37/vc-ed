## What is CHAPI?

This is a tutorial to teach you the basics of CHAPI! CHAPI (Credential Handler API) is a protocol that mediates between digital wallets and a 3rd party issuer or verifier, so that you can easily exchange credentials in and out of whatever wallet you happen to use. It does this by popping up a little box on the 3rd party's website (or a popup window if 3rd party cookies are blocked), where you can interface with your wallet and accept or send out credential information. You can read more about CHAPI at its [project website](https://chapi.io/).

## The _Intro to CHAPI_ Badge

Tody we will be receiving an _Intro to CHAPI_ badge that we can store in our wallets, and in the process we will learn a bit about how CHAPI works! Start by opening up the [CHAPI Playground](https://playground.chapi.io/issuer).

## Set up your Wallet

If you don't yet have a digital wallet set up, you will need one to authenticate and receive your credential today. The CHAPI team currently recommends the [Veres](https://demo.vereswallet.dev/) and [LearnCard](https://learncard.app/login) digital wallets for use with the protocol. Make an account with whichever you prefer.
